Description of the project
==========================
The project attempted is a Course Management System. Since it is virtually impossible to do a course management system within the time frame of about two weeks, this project only involves a part of the CMS.

The subsystems in the CMS include the following:
1. Course Management
2. User Management
3. Section Management
4. Notes Management
5. Teacher Management
6. Class Management
7. Messaging System
8. Task List
9. Enrollment Management
10. Framework Management
11. Course Code Management
12. Subject Management

For this project, only (4) will be demonstrated. However, most of the databases had to be in place as they interlinked.

Technical notes
===============
The tables in database involved are:
1. Users
2. Subjects
3. Course Codes
4. Courses
5. Course Section (or Lesson)
6. Section Notes
7. Enrollment
8. Course Roles
9. Note Types

Use of Laravel
==============
Laravel 5 is used in this project. It was a nightmare as there was a delay in the release (it was scheduled for Nov 2014), and the system (as of now) cannot be compiled. Hence I spent more time just finding the bugs and fixing them rather than working on my codes.  It was too late to revert to L4 as the features are quite different.

Demo Information
================
Demonstration will be on the CRUD on notes only.  But feel free to try the rest. It is far from bug free as it is a huge system, I will need quite a few months to complete this system.  Video: <a href="http://screencast.com/t/W6vt9dhy">Click here</a>
